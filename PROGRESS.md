# BrandLens — PROGRESS

> This is the memory between `/clear`s. Claude reads it first in every session and rewrites **Handoff** at the end of every phase.

**Current phase:** P08 done → next P09
**Build window:** Day 1 = `YYYY-MM-DD` (fill in). Milestones: Day 7 core loop · Day 11 feature complete · Day 14 submit.

## Handoff (latest — overwrite each phase)

- **Phase / status:** P08 / done (branch `phase/P08-editor-findings`, stacked on P07 → … → P00; none merged). Built by Claude for Jagpreet's phase under `/complete`; Jagpreet should review the UX.
- **⚠ Still open for Maanit:** update the retired model IDs in `apps/worker/.env` (Open questions).
- **What exists now (web):**
  - **`lib/editor/offsets.ts`**, the only place positions are computed: `docToText`/`textToDocJSON` (paragraph per line, `\n` separators, hard break = `\n`), `textOffsetToPos`/`posToTextOffset`, `cpToUtf16`/`utf16ToCp` (worker spans are **code points**, JS is UTF-16), and `spanToRange`. Tests cover the hero spans, multi-paragraph text, marks, hard breaks, emoji and multibyte text.
  - **`lib/editor/findings-extension.ts`:** highlights are a ProseMirror **decoration** plugin (`finding-hl finding-{severity}`, `finding-active`), mapped through edits. `currentRange(state, id)` gives the live range for applying a fix. CSS lives in `globals.css`.
  - **`lib/drafts/`:**
    - `intent.ts`: zod `intentSchema` (SPEC §5), `CHANNELS`, `DISMISS_REASONS`.
    - `actions.ts`: `createDraft`; `submitForCheck({contentId, body, intent}, upload?)` inserts a new version (DOCX/PDF/image upload to `drafts/{org}/{content}/{uuid}/…`), then `enqueue_review`; `resolveFinding` (accepted/edited/dismissed with a reason/routed for claims blockers only/open). The DB trigger stamps the resolver and writes `audit_events`.
  - **`/drafts`:** own content list plus a new-draft form (title, channel, campaign).
  - **`/drafts/[id]`:** server page loads the content, current version, latest run and its non-superseded findings, and builds citations. **Agencies get `rule_cards_public` summaries**; staff get title and summary; facts show their statement; WCAG gets a label. Realtime refreshes on `review_runs`/`findings`/`contents`.
  - **`DraftWorkspace`:**
    - TipTap StarterKit (no headings/code/quote) plus highlights.
    - Intent panel validated with zod; the campaign is fixed to the content's.
    - "Submit for check" / "Resubmit for check" is disabled while any blocker is open, with the reason shown.
    - Run status, degraded banner and failure banner.
    - Findings sorted open-first then blocker → warning → suggestion.
    - Uncited findings are never rendered (console error in dev).
  - **`FindingCard`:**
    - Heading button with `aria-expanded`; severity, codes, dimension, "AI-assisted" and status; confidence chip with "Needs human review" below 0.6; cited sources; old → new diff.
    - Accept is disabled with an explanation when there's no rewrite or confidence < 0.6. Edit (textarea → apply), Dismiss (radio reason + note), Route to Legal (claims blockers), Reopen.
    - Hover and keyboard focus highlight the span; only keyboard focus scrolls the editor.
  - **`getSession`:** a failed membership query now throws instead of sending users to `/no-access`, and **retries once on `PGRST303 "JWT issued at future"`** (a token used in the same second it was minted).
  - E2E `e2e/drafts.spec.ts` (`E2E_WORKER=1`): the full creator flow, agency summaries, keyboard expand/tab, and **axe WCAG 2.2 AA on a draft page with findings (0 violations)**.
- **Acceptance (local, 2026-10-26):** all passed.
  - The creator pastes the hero, fills intent, submits; **findings appear live** and the highlights' text matches all four hero quotes exactly. Accepting G-07, E-19 and F-048 rewrites the editor ("PayWise", "Oct 28, 7:00 PM IST (online)"); routing CL-03 to legal then enables Resubmit.
  - The agency sees the CL-03 summary, never the body.
  - Keyboard: tab to a finding, Enter toggles, Tab enters the card.
  - Offsets tests pass (69 web unit tests).
- **Gotchas:**
  - `PGRST303` locally: GoTrue and PostgREST clocks can disagree by under a second, and Docker Desktop's VM clock also drifts after the Mac sleeps. If it persists, restart Docker Desktop.
  - Don't scroll on mouse focus: it moves the target between mousedown and mouseup and swallows the click.
  - Don't use `opacity` for "resolved" styling: it fails contrast (axe caught 8 nodes).
  - LLM findings vary per run, so e2e asserts "at least" the deterministic set.
- **Stubbed / deferred:**
  - PDF/image submissions are accepted by the UI but the worker marks them `unsupported_format` until P11/P12 (a notice is shown).
  - The `changes_requested → draft` revise button is P09.
  - There's no version diff yet (P09).
- **Exact next step:** P09 (review workflow, routing, comments, diff, notifications): `/review` queue sorted by risk, reviewer view with approve/request changes/overrides/sign-off via `transition_content`, comments, version diff (`diff` pkg), and Discord (+ optional Resend) notifications.

## Decisions log (append-only)

| Date | Phase | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-26 | pre | Groq primary, Gemini fallback (free tiers) | No paid LLM budget |
| 2026-10-26 | pre | Email/password auth + demo role switcher; no OAuth | Simpler; judge-friendly |
| 2026-10-26 | pre | Discord webhook instead of Slack | Team preference |
| 2026-10-26 | pre | Langfuse Cloud instead of self-hosted | Dev speed; demo data is fictional |
| 2026-10-26 | pre | Next.js 16 instead of 15 | Current stable |
| 2026-10-26 | pre | Second LLM sample only for blocker findings | Resolves the plan's one-call vs two-sample contradiction |
| 2026-10-26 | P00 | Env validated in `instrumentation.ts` (boot) **and** root layout (build) | Instrumentation alone misses `next build`; layout alone only fails on first request in dev |
| 2026-10-26 | P00 | Pure `lib/env-schema.ts` split from eager `lib/env.ts` | Lets Vitest test schemas without a real env |
| 2026-10-26 | P00 | Worker app built via `create_app()` factory (`uvicorn --factory`) | Settings validated at startup, while tests/CI import without env |
| 2026-10-26 | P00 | Blank env values count as missing (web and worker) | Lets you verify fail-fast via `VAR= make dev-*` without editing `.env*` |
| 2026-10-26 | P00 | `LLM_FALLBACK_PROVIDER` accepts `groq`/`gemini`/`none` | Allows disabling the fallback explicitly |
| 2026-10-26 | P00 | `make dev` uses `make -j2` rather than a `concurrently` dep | One fewer dependency |
| 2026-10-26 | P00 | shadcn `base-nova` preset (Base UI primitives, `cn` package) | Current shadcn default; restyled in P02 |
| 2026-10-26 | P00 | Kept `httpx` for TestClient and filtered the starlette deprecation warning | Adding `httpx2` was blocked by the permission classifier; revisit if needed |
| 2026-10-26 | P01 | Local Supabase ports 543xx → 553xx | Another local Supabase stack holds the defaults; we don't stop other projects |
| 2026-10-26 | P01 | Added `decisions.finding_id` (override decisions point at the warning they override) | §4 requires an override per open warning; also feeds GCS ReviewerOverrideRate (§11) |
| 2026-10-26 | P01 | Rule table lives in `private.apply_transition`; both public entry points and `enqueue_review` call it | One rule table for user and worker transitions (§4) |
| 2026-10-26 | P01 | `transition_content` takes optional `p_route_to` (manual escalation); `transition_content_system` takes `p_route_to`, `p_risk_score` | Worker computes §10 from config.py weights; SQL applies the redirect |
| 2026-10-26 | P01 | Added system transition `ai_check → draft` (reason required) | A failed run must not strand content in ai_check |
| 2026-10-26 | P01 | Workflow-column guard uses a txn-local GUC set only inside definer functions | Blocks direct `state` writes from every client, including manual SQL as non-superuser roles |
| 2026-10-26 | P01 | Users update findings via column grants (`status`, `dismiss_reason`, `dismiss_note`); trigger stamps resolver and audits | Minimal surface; no free-form edits of worker output |
| 2026-10-26 | P01 | `match_vault` is service-role only and also returns `content`/`value` | It returns rule bodies, which agencies must not see; the worker needs the snippet text |
| 2026-10-26 | P01 | At most one `approved` version per rule code (partial unique index) | Retrieval and citations must resolve to exactly one card |
| 2026-10-26 | P01 | `drafts/` and `renders/` paths carry the content id as segment 2 | Lets storage RLS apply agency "own content only" rules |
| 2026-10-26 | P01 | Added `enqueue_vault_job()` for `vault_jobs` | Web never touches pgmq directly (CLAUDE.md gotcha) |
| 2026-10-26 | P01 | E-19 `valid_until` = campaign end (2026-11-15), not event day | Demo must still retrieve E-19 after Oct 28 |
| 2026-10-26 | P01 | Demo password `PayWise-demo-2026`, fixed UUIDs, cloud users created with the same ids | Local and cloud demo data are identical; documented in README |
| 2026-10-26 | P01 | Campaigns writable by manager and brand_admin | SPEC §2 is silent; managers run campaigns |
| 2026-10-26 | P02 | Turned off `cacheComponents`/`partialPrefetching` | Every page reads the session; Suspense-wrapping every read buys nothing for an authenticated tool |
| 2026-10-26 | P02 | `can()` is boolean over a tri-state `access()` (`full`/`limited`/`none`); footnoted ● counts as `limited` | UI gating needs "at all?" plus "scoped?" |
| 2026-10-26 | P02 | Specialists land on `/review` (no Drafts nav); everyone else on `/drafts` | Specialists can't submit content (SPEC §2) |
| 2026-10-26 | P02 | Demo role switcher is a labelled `<select>` + Switch button | Change-on-select violates WCAG 3.2.2 |
| 2026-10-26 | P02 | Demo password lives only in the server action module | It's documented, but still never shipped to the browser |
| 2026-10-26 | P02 | axe-core (WCAG 2.2 AA tags) in Playwright stands in for Lighthouse | Automatable in CI; covers the same a11y rules |
| 2026-10-26 | P03 | Review-queue messages without `type` default to `review_version`; vault messages use `job` | `enqueue_review()` (P01) sends `{run_id, version_id, org_id}` only |
| 2026-10-26 | P03 | Poison messages archived after 3 reads; failed runs send content `ai_check → draft` | Never strand content or loop forever on a crashing job |
| 2026-10-26 | P03 | Validation retry lives in `BaseProvider`; router treats `InvalidOutput` as non-retryable (→ fallback) | One retry with the error, per CLAUDE.md, then the other provider |
| 2026-10-26 | P03 | Validation-retry message lists field errors only, never the model's raw output | Raw output may quote draft text |
| 2026-10-26 | P03 | Langfuse generations record metadata (ids/counts/versions) as input, not prompts | Invariant 5 / "inputs logged as redacted text only" (stricter) |
| 2026-10-26 | P03 | Recommended model IDs: Groq `openai/gpt-oss-120b` (text), `qwen/qwen3.8-27b` (vision); Gemini `gemini-3.5-flash` | Configured models retired; these verified working 2026-10-26 |
| 2026-10-26 | P04 | CSV import = web route handler (`/api/vault/import`), zod-validated, RLS-scoped upsert, all-or-nothing | PHASES recommendation; no worker HTTP surface needed |
| 2026-10-26 | P04 | Extracted card whose code already exists → draft **version n+1** of that code | Re-ingesting a guide proposes updates instead of colliding on `unique(org_id, code, version)` |
| 2026-10-26 | P04 | Chunk budget 700 tokens (SPEC cap 1,500) | Real runs missed rules on 1,450-token chunks |
| 2026-10-26 | P04 | `embedding_source_hash` columns decide re-embedding | Covers in-place edits (e.g. examples appended in P13), not just new rows |
| 2026-10-26 | P04 | `enqueue_vault_job` allows the service role | `seed_demo.py` and the worker can queue embeddings |
| 2026-10-26 | P04 | Seed `source_page` values changed to match the generated `guide.pdf` | Citations must open the right page |
| 2026-10-26 | P05 | Approve/revise via SQL RPCs (`approve_rule_card`, `revise_rule_card`) | Archive-old + approve-new must be atomic under the one-approved-per-code index |
| 2026-10-26 | P05 | Editing an approved card creates version n+1 (old archived), drafts edit in place | Findings keep citing the exact text they were checked against |
| 2026-10-26 | P05 | Vault tabs and the card editor are URL state (`?tab=`, `&card=`) | Keyboard/back-button friendly, server-rendered, no client tab state |
| 2026-10-26 | P05 | Realtime client sets the JWT on the socket before subscribing; polling fallback while parsing | SSR client loads the session async; RLS drops events for anon sockets |
| 2026-10-26 | P05 | Managers/specialists are denied `/vault` (not read-only) | SPEC §2 allows "read-only or denied"; denied is simpler and safer |
| 2026-10-26 | P05 | `make test-db` resets the local DB first | pgTAP asserts seed state; local e2e mutates it |
| 2026-10-26 | P06 | F-112 missing-disclaimer check **merged** into the overlapping CL-03 finding (rule_id + fact_id) | One finding per issue; matches SPEC §16's "CL-03+F-112 blocker" |
| 2026-10-26 | P06 | Adjacent conflicting event entities become one finding; primary citation = this campaign's fact, bleed fact named in the explanation | "Oct 18 at Hall B, Chandigarh" is one mistake with one fix |
| 2026-10-26 | P06 | Reading grade only on drafts ≥60 words; exclamation check needs ≥2 "!" | Formulas and density are noise on one-line captions |
| 2026-10-26 | P06 | Tone banned phrasing = short quoted phrases in approved tone-rule bodies | Derives from the vault; no hardcoded list |
| 2026-10-26 | P06 | `Vault.facts` includes every org fact; scoping happens in the filter | Bleed detection needs the out-of-campaign facts |
| 2026-10-26 | P06 | Ruff ignores RUF001/002/003 | Brand copy and regexes deliberately use typographic characters |
| 2026-10-26 | P07 | Gate matches quotes on the unredacted whitespace-normalised `Doc.text`, mapped to original offsets at persistence | Same text the deterministic stages use; char map keeps spans exact |
| 2026-10-26 | P07 | Intent verification (§9) applies to LLM rewrites; deterministic rewrites are asserted to pass step 4 in tests | Code-generated fixes are correct by construction; cosine on long disclaimer rewrites would null good fixes |
| 2026-10-26 | P07 | Confirmation sample only when the main sample returns a blocker | SPEC §7 / CLAUDE.md deviation table |
| 2026-10-26 | P07 | Langfuse generation input = counts/ids only; output = finding count | Stricter than "redacted text" (invariant 5) |
| 2026-10-26 | P07 | Explicit SQL casts (`::uuid`, `::text`, `::real`) on RPC calls from the worker | psycopg binds floats as double precision; overload resolution failed |
| 2026-10-26 | P08 | Finding highlights are ProseMirror decorations, not marks | Never alter the saved text; they map through edits for free |
| 2026-10-26 | P08 | Version body = editor textblocks joined by `\n`; worker spans (code points) converted to UTF-16 in `offsets.ts` | One tested mapping; emoji-safe |
| 2026-10-26 | P08 | Accept/Edit apply the fix in the editor; the server only records status (audited by trigger) | Resubmitting creates the new immutable version (SPEC §4) |
| 2026-10-26 | P08 | Session load retries once on PGRST303 and throws (not /no-access) on query errors | Sub-second clock skew right after sign-in; errors must not masquerade as "no org" |

## Open questions (ask the user; don't guess)

- [ ] Build window Day-1 date?
- [ ] Worker host: Railway or Fly? (Needed by P10.)
- [ ] Does the Supabase cloud project already exist (Mumbai)? Is its URL in the env files?
- [ ] Is Resend email wanted, or Discord only?
- [ ] **Update model IDs in `apps/worker/.env`** (see the P03 handoff; the configured Groq/Gemini models are retired).
